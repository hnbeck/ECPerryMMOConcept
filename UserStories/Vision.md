## Vision

### Version: V0.1

Perry Rhodan is a big universe including many spaceships, planets, societies and galaxies. Perry MMO (draft title) is intended to provide gamers means to experience and influence stories with Perry Rhodan, Atlan, Bull, Gucky and others. The storie on the level of galaxies like descition of leaders, main characters and societies is prescribed by autors. In this way the universe evolves. Any gamer should have the possibility to experience adventures like first contact with a different species, space battels and much more.


### Task for the player

The players solve quests. These quests can be commanded by main characters or it can be induced by missions initiated from something like Liga Freier Terraner etc.

### Game mechanics


The game works like an adventure. The player explores things, act in the range of a command set (and later in a graphics version action set). Gameplay shall be Web Browser only.

### Condition of winning

Stay alife, and fulfill missions. May be there is a carrer system, so you can achieve a own command. 

### Intention of the project

Interactive story telling induces many questions, some are listed below. To find an answer to them, to evaluate constraints and design principls is intention of this project. It is therefore a precursor and pathfinder of project maybe comming in future.

Beside this, it is also a trial out machine for working with my theory about rules and logical description of actions, like situation calculus or others implemented in Prolog.

### Questions

Here an initial list of questions with no logical order:

* should ther be different levels of events ? There may be events prescribed by autors and events initiated by the system

* is a career system useful? Should a player have the possibility to level up to a chief scientist or captain of a spaceship ? And if so, what whould be the relation to other players?

* How to prevent a to hard involvment of autors? They can not prescribe every action. How to build an expose system or script system which allows to control the main story lines some weeks per script ?

* How important will be strong relation to the Perry Rhodan publications for acceptance ? Which questions to licencse and law would trigger this?

* Fights are a common part of Perry stories. Its also part of many games. Which priority should fights have. How will they performed ? Should a single player fight, or should a player as a team of a 50m Circle space ship fight ? Will he part of a command deck crew?

* How often the player may change its role, a planet or a ship? Should this even be possible?

* Is a capability system necessary, which would induce that some action or a role could only be done if some capability is developed ?
  

There may be a lot more questions during the project. They will be recorded as design constraints.
