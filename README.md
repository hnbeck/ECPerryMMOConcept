# PerrysNGZOnlineRQ


Here you can find a User Story based description of the Perry MMO Game. The Goal is to define a technical concept. Constraints and goals for the concept are derived in the documents of this github project.

The game is planned to be an adventure as an interaktive story telling. The prototype will have differnet stages of technical complexity: 

- textbased
- elementary graphics
- Concept art graphics

The main issue of the prototype is to evaluate gameplay, story quality and concept of interactive SiFi story telling.

An initial description can be found here: https://www.educational-concepts.biz/project/perryrhodanmmo/

At this moment in time the game has no name. The working title is PerrysNGZOnline. NGZ is Neue Galaktische Zeitrechnung, the calender used in the stories about Perry Rhodan.

The documents are in German, but this may change later.
