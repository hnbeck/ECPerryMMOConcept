# EC Perry MMO RQ

Here you can find a User Story based description of the EC Perry MMO Game to be developed. The goal is to define a technical concept for a prototype to gain initial experiences. Constraints and detailed goals for the concept are derived in the documents of this github repo.

The game is planned to be an adventure featuring an interactive story telling. The prototype will have different stages of technical complexity: 

- text based, maybe with simple graphics and small mission
- elementary graphics with bigger mission and more characters
- concept art graphics, at least a solar system and big gameplay

The main issue of the prototype is to evaluate gameplay, story quality and concept of interactive SciFi story telling.

At this moment in time the game has no name. The working title is EC Perry MMO.
