Here you can find a User Story based description of the Perry MMO Game in front. The goal is to define a technical concept for a prototype to gain initial experiences. Constraints and detailed goals for the concept are derived in the documents of this github project.

The game is planned to be an adventure featuring an interaktive story telling. The prototype will have different stages of technical complexity: 

- textbased
- elementary graphics
- Concept art graphics

The main issue of the prototype is to evaluate gameplay, story quality and concept of interactive SiFi story telling.

An initial description can be found here: https://www.educational-concepts.biz/project/perryrhodanmmo/

At this moment in time the game has no name. The working title is Perry MMO. 
The documents are in German, but this may change later.
